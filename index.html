          <h3>Software developer</h3>
          <p>
            Our latest project is called
            <a href='http://wordbaseapp.com'>Wordbase</a>, it’s a fun game. We
            are searching for a second developer who can help us developing the
            server-side of the game.  It’s written in Python. And we like Python.
            Hope you like it too.  We are using Flask and SQLAlchemy, but you
            don’t need to know them. But we hope that you know how databases and
            web works.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have other server-side software written in Ruby and Rails, which
            you will get to work as well. But we can’t wait to start a new
            project in something that involves Clojure, Erlang, Scala or OCaml.
            So if you know those it’s cool as well. We want you to be good at
            both functional and object-oriented programming, as well as
            test-driven development.
          </p>

          <h3>Robocat</h3>
          <p>
            Here at
            <a href='http://robo.cat'>Robocat</a>
            we make apps and games for mobile devices. Our projects are small,
            but focused.  We want you to work at our office in downtown
            Copenhagen (near Nørreport station), but homeworking some of
            the time is cool too. If you want to move to Copenhagen—we will try
            to help.  We are looking for a full-time developer, but we can
            compromise on that if we really want to hire you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are small, profitable, self-bootstrapped and easy going.
            Right now we are 5 full-time and 5 part-time employees.
