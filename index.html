          <h3>Sales &amp; Distribution Manager</h3>
          <p>We’re looking for someone with sales experience to join our team either on location in Copenhagen or remote. We’ve got this great little product called <a href="http://thermodo.com">Thermodo</a>, a tiny little thermometer for your smartphone. We had a great <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robocat/thermodo-the-tiny-thermometer-for-mobile-devices">Kickstarter campaign</a> and are now in that wonderful time where our product needs to grow up and take on an even bigger audience. We’ve got our supply set up and thousands of units in stock. We’ve got a webshop that’s selling units on a daily basis and a lot of interest from distributors and retailers.</p>

          <p>So why do we need you? We’re builders and dreamers and we have very little experience in sales. We need someone who can set up and close deals with distributors and retailers. If you have experience in ecommerce, affiliate marketing, SEO, running ad campaigns and generally selling products on the internet, that is also a plus. But mostly we’re looking for someone who is motivated, understands our product and shares our passion and who can help us navigate this brave new world.</p>

          <h3>Software developer</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! We are searching for software developers who can help us
            developing the server-side. We have a few projects, one of them is
            called
            <a href='http://wordbaseapp.com'>Wordbase</a>,
            it’s a fun word game for mobile. The back-end and game logic is
            written in Python. We like Python and we hope you like it too. We
            are using Flask and SQLAlchemy, but you don’t need to know them. We
            do hope that you know how databases and web work though.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have other server-side software written in Ruby on Rails, which
            you might get to work on as well. We can’t wait to get started with
            new projects in something that could involve Clojure, Erlang, Scala
            or OCaml. So if you know those, that’s cool as well. We want you to
            be good at both functional and object-oriented programming, as well
            as test-driven development.
          </p>

          <h3>Robocat</h3>
          <p>
            We are
            <a href='http://robo.cat'>Robocat</a>.
            We make apps, games and hardware for mobile devices. Our projects
            are small, but focused. We are profitable, self-bootstrapped and
            easy going. We want you to work at our office in downtown
            Copenhagen (near Nørreport station), but working from home at times
            is cool too. If you want to move to Copenhagen — we will try to
            help. We are looking for full-time developers, part time positions
            are also possible.
