          <h3>Software developer</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! We are searching for software developers who can help us
            developing the server-side. We have a few projects, one of them is
            called
            <a href='http://wordbaseapp.com'>Wordbase</a>,
            it’s a fun word game for mobile. The back-end and game logic is
            written in Python. We like Python and we hope you like it too. We
            are using Flask and SQLAlchemy, but you don’t need to know them. We
            do hope that you know how databases and web work though.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have other server-side software written in Ruby on Rails, which
            you might get to work on as well. We can’t wait to get started with
            new projects in something that could involve Clojure, Erlang, Scala
            or OCaml. So if you know those, that’s cool as well. We want you to
            be good at both functional and object-oriented programming, as well
            as test-driven development.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are
            <a href='http://robo.cat'>Robocat</a>.
            We make apps, games and hardware for mobile devices. Our projects
            are small, but focused. We are profitable, self-bootstrapped and
            easy going. We want you to work at our office in downtown
            Copenhagen (near Nørreport station), but working from home at times
            is cool too. If you want to move to Copenhagen — we will try to
            help. We are looking for full-time developers, part time positions
            are also possible.
